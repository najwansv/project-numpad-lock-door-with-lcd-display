The Project Numpad Lock Door with LCD Display is a simple security system that allows users to lock and unlock a door using a numeric keypad. The system consists of a keypad, an LCD display, and a locking mechanism that can be controlled via a microcontroller such as an Arduino.

The user enters a preset combination on the keypad, and the microcontroller sends a signal to the locking mechanism to either lock or unlock the door. The LCD display provides feedback to the user, displaying messages such as "locked" or "unlocked" as well as any error messages.

The project is relatively easy to set up and can be customized for various use cases, such as securing a home, office, or other location. The LCD display can also be programmed to display additional information, such as the current date and time, or even weather forecasts.
